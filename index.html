            <h2><span class="name-highlight"> Shahriar's </span>Dream</h2>
            <h3>Become a World-Class Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>I have a deep passion for technology and programming. Since I started my journey in Computer Science and Engineering, I've been fascinated by the power of code to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. I spend countless hours learning new programming languages, exploring cutting-edge technologies, and building projects that challenge my skills. </br>
        I love the creative process of software development - from designing elegant algorithms to crafting user-friendly interfaces. Every line of code I write is a step toward my ultimate goal. For me, programming is not just a career choice, it's a way of thinking and problem-solving that excites me every day. I call it "Digital Artistry". </br>
        My dream is to work at top tech companies like Google, Microsoft, or Apple, and eventually become a leading software engineer who creates groundbreaking applications that millions of people use worldwide. I want to contribute to open-source projects and mentor the next generation of developers.</p>

            <h2><span class="hobby-highlight"> Volunteering </span></h2>
            <p>
                Volunteering is a voluntary act of an individual or group freely giving time and labour for community service. With busy lives, it can be hard to find time to volunteer. However, the benefits of volunteering can be enormous. Volunteering offers vital help to people in need, worthwhile causes, and the community, but the benefits can be even greater for us. Volunteering can help you make friends, learn new skills, advance your career, and even feel happier and healthier. </br>
                Volunteering is a way to show gratitude by helping others or working for a noble cause without expecting anything in return. So, I thought I can make it a hobby to rediscover myself. Practicing a hobby like volunteering in free time gives me self-satisfaction and inner peace. How great the hobby is if it contributes to making someone's life better!

            <h2><span class="hobby-highlight"> Gardening </span></h2>
            <p>
                Gardening is a very pleasant and rewarding hobby. As I'm a nature lover, I have a hobby of gardening because I love nature's scenic beauty.I grow different types of plants, shrubs, bushes where flowers blossom in my garden. </br>
                Gardening is a pastime meant for the anyone. It's healthy, beautiful and rewarding. I love being in my garden and experiencing the silent scientific processes taking place all around me. While working in the garden not only I spend my time in a better way but also improve my health as thus I take exercise unwillingly. It brings me close to nature and I feel lost like Wordsworth in the beauty of blooms and blossoms around me.Gardening is an activity that's good for both the mind and body, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Plus, I get to eat the delicious fruits, vegetables.
